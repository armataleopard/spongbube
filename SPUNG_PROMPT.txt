PROJECT: SpungBObe ($SPUNG)

TASK: Create a modern, ultra-animated and fun HTML website for a memecoin called SpungBObe ($SPUNG) using a chaotic and meme-driven design.
Do NOT use boilerplate text. Everything must be visually wild, bold and funny.

STRUCTURE:

1. HEADER
- Centered LOGO (logo.jpg)
- Explosive animation when logo is hovered or loaded.
- Right corner: Twitter button → https://x.com/spungbobe

2. HERO SECTION
- Fullscreen BANNER (banner.jpg) with spinning elements
- Large slogan in graffiti-style font: "Straight outta Bikini Bottom"
- Subtitle (animated): “More soaked than your bag”
- Big animated CTA: “BUY $SPUNG ON PUMPFUN” — link to https://pump.fun

3. ABOUT SPUNGBObe
- Side-by-side: 
  - Left: funny art image (1.jpg)
  - Right: Paragraph:
    "Once a simple sponge, now a liquidity menace. $SPUNG was born from a wet keyboard and a dream. It’s a token, it’s a joke, it’s your next loss. Dive in or dry out."

4. MEME WALL / GALLERY
- Grid with each image (2.jpg – 5.jpg)
- Under each, a meme-caption:
  - “Patrick got rugged and joined a cartel.”
  - “SpongeBob sold the bottom. Again.”
  - “Squidward is our dev. Don't ask.”
  - “Gary’s locked liquidity and the key is missing.”

5. THE PLAN
- Timeline-style Roadmap:
  - Q1: Launch. Bikini Bottom goes long.
  - Q2: Listings? Nah, just vibes.
  - Q3: Community makes memes, coin hits peak stupidity.
  - Q4: Animated movie? (Not financial advice)

6. CHAOS SECTION (Optional overlay)
- Show flashing images with SFX
- Text: "You thought it was a joke. But $SPUNG is eternal."

7. FOOTER
- Repeats logo (small)
- Twitter button again
- Disclaimer: “Not affiliated with Nickelodeon. Please don’t sue. Also not responsible for your financial decisions.”

STYLE:
- Font: Bangers, Comic Neue
- Colors: neon yellow, seafoam green, deep ocean blue
- Animations: spin, shake, bounce, neon flicker, scale-in
- Everything should feel like you're browsing a cursed TV channel underwater

NOTES:
- Add animated floating elements: bubbles, fishes, and cash
- Add hover FX on all images (scale and flash)
- Make sure every piece of text can be easily changed
- Code should be clean HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)

GOAL: Make it wild, immersive, and absolutely unhinged.
